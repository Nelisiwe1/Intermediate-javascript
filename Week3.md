# What is node.js
Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers the Google Chrome web browser, and it provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that makes it particularly well-suited for building scalable and high-performance network applications.

2. How is Node JS initiated on a computer?
Through the command line interface 

3. Node.js is fast, lightweight and efficient. 

4. Node.js can generate dynamic page content
Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server

5. Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node.js application.
Node.js can collect form data
Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

6. Node Package Manager, is a popular package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is primarily used for managing and distributing open-source JavaScript packages and libraries.

7.   A package contains all the files needed for a module, which is a JavaScript library that can be included in a Node project.

# Node.js Libraries
Node.js can be used to create fun and games, particularly on the server side, handle real-time interactions, and manage game logic. While Node.js itself is not typically used for building the client-side game engines (for that, you'd typically use HTML5 and JavaScript).

**Configuring game development**

npm init- is used to initialise the project

npm i --save-dev babel-cli babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-register html-webpack-plugin nodemon webpack uglifyjs-webpack-plugin@1.1.6 - is used to install all the dependencies.

npm i --save body-parser cors express socket.io - other packages that are necessary to be installed.

Run the npm audit fix command to fix any errors

# Client-side Game development.

Client-side game development involves creating and running games directly in web browsers using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach leverages the capabilities of modern web technologies to develop interactive, visually appealing games that can be played on a wide range of devices without the need for users to install any additional software

JavaScript for Game Logic: Write JavaScript code to handle game logic, including elements like player controls, game physics, collision detection, and scoring. You can use vanilla JavaScript or choose from various game development libraries and engines, such as:

Phaser: A popular 2D game framework that provides a range of features for game development.

Graphics and Animation: Create or import game assets such as images, sprites, textures, and animations.
